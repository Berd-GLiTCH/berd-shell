# berd-shell

Hi berd here, this is the **Berd 2.0 shell** *as I like to call it* This ZIP file has everything you need to do your moderating stuff, host the bot 24/7 or only have it on when you need it. 

I created this bot because I believe moderation should be extremely easy to access and use and without features locked behind a paywall.

## **REQUIREMENTS**
- Nextcord (latest)
- Python (latest)
- A can do attitude

## **Comprehensive guide to doing this ;)**
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create an application and name it whatever!
3. Click on the 'Bot' tab on the left hand side
4. Click on 'Add Bot' and then, 'Yes, do it!'
5. click the 'Copy' button underneath the token section (top of the page)
6. Head on over to main.py, and where it says 'TOKEN' delete the word and replace it with the copied code!
7. (You should probably add permissions on the bot in the OAuth2 tab on Discord Developer Portal)
    - Click on OAuth2 then select the sub 'URL Generator'
    - On scopes select: bot, applications.commands
    - on bot permissions select: Administrator (If you trust the code here enough) **OR** Send Messages, Read Messages/View Channels (This is bare essential but the bot       can't do very much, just use your common sense on what the permissions do)
    
## **PLEASE DOWNLOAD AN IDE OR ANYTHING THAT EDITS CODE**
You don't have to but I'd think it would be easier for someone instead of faffing around with Command Prompt or Terminal, plus on the bright side you can add stuff and remove stuff easily with an IDE 

- **Visual Studio Code** https://code.visualstudio.com/download (Recommended)
- **Visual Studio** https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads (Not recommended, unless you want to get into coding further. Very heavy)
- **Atom** https://atom.io (Recommended, very lightweight)
