# berd-shell

Hi berd here, this is the **Berd 2.0 shell** *as I like to call it* This ZIP file has everything you need to do your moderating stuff, host the bot 24/7 or only have it on when you need it. 

I created this bot because I believe moderation should be extremely easy to access and use and without features locked behind a paywall.

**REQUIREMENTS**
- Hikari (latest)
- Python (latest)
- A can do attitude
